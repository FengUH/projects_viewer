## 🚀 Project Overview

Feng EEG Project Viewer is an interactive Streamlit app that demonstrates a complete workflow for:

Multi-channel EEG signal visualization

Functional connectivity matrix construction

CNN-based classification between Depression and AD

Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity (dFNC) and brain-state transitions

The goal is to provide a clean, interview-ready, and research-oriented demo that highlights Feng’s expertise in neuroscience, signal processing, machine learning, and scientific visualization.
