# 🔗 Live Demo

An interactive demo summarizing Feng's prior works — including multi-channel EEG time-series processing and statistical / linear-regression modeling for patient assessment and prediction. The demo also showcases CNN-based patient phenotyping and k-means clustering for temporal-pattern discovery and dynamic brain-state classification.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Feng EEG Project Viewer is an interactive Streamlit app that demonstrates a complete workflow for:

* Multi-channel EEG signal visualization

* unctional connectivity matrix construction

* CNN-based classification between Depression and AD

* Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity (dFNC) and brain-state transitions

---

## 🧩 Key Features
1. Multi-Channel Time Series EEG Signals

* Simulated multi-channel EEG time series

* Optional smoothing / denoising

* Sliding-window segmentation for downstream analysis

2. Functional Connectivity Matrices

* Correlation / statistical-dependency–based connectivity

* Multiple matrices with distinct patterns for visual comparison

3. CNN Classification (Depression vs. AD)

* Concise CNN architecture summary (convolution, pooling, dense layers)

* ROC curve with AUC ≈ 0.91

* Confusion matrix with rotated axis labels (Depression vs. AD)

4. Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity (dFNC)

* Sliding-window functional connectivity estimation

* k-means clustering into multiple network states

* State-specific connectivity matrices

* Timeline plot showing when each state is active
