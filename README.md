# 🔗 Live Demo

An interactive demo summarizing Feng's prior works — including multi-channel EEG time-series processing and statistical / linear-regression modeling for patient assessment and prediction. The demo also showcases CNN-based patient phenotyping and k-means clustering for temporal-pattern discovery and dynamic brain-state classification.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Feng EEG Project Viewer is an interactive Streamlit app that demonstrates a complete workflow for:

* Multi-channel EEG signal visualization

* unctional connectivity matrix construction

* CNN-based classification between Depression and AD

* ynamic Functional Network Connectivity (dFNC) and brain-state transitions

The goal is to provide a clean, interview-ready, and research-oriented demo that highlights Feng’s expertise in neuroscience, signal processing, machine learning, and scientific visualization.
